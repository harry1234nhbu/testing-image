                    She has power over death. He has power over her. When two enemies strike a dangerous bargain, 
                    will they end a war . . . or ignite one?
                    Heroes die, cowards live. Daughter of a conquered world, Ruying hates the invaders who descended from the heavens
                     long before she was born and defeated the magic of her people with technologies unlike anything her world had ever seen.
                     Blessed by Death, born with the ability to pull the life right out of mortal bodies, Ruying shouldn’t have to fear these foreign
                      invaders, but she does. Especially because she wants to keep herself and her family safe.When Ruying’s Gift is discovered by
                       an enemy prince, he offers her an impossible deal: If she becomes his private assassin and eliminates his political
                        rivals–whose deaths he swears would be for the good of both their worlds and would protect her people from further 
                        brutalization–her family will never starve or suffer harm again. But to accept this bargain, she must use the powers
                         she has always feared, powers that will shave years off her own existence.Can Ruying trust this prince, whose promises of a 
                         better world make her heart ache and whose smiles make her pulse beat faster? Are the evils of this agreement really in the 
                         service of a much greater good? Or will she betray her entire nation by protecting those she loves the most?</p>
